FaceReplace takes two image files divided into smaller regions, or 'faces', and matches the face from one of
the images to the same face on the other image.  The faces are permuted on each image so that each face does not
appear in the same area of both images.

Java 8 is required to run this program.  The Habanero Java library (HJ-lib) is included with this package.  Visit
https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/PARPROG/HJ+Library for more information about Habanero Java and/or the
Habanero library in general.

Running the program should be as simple as pulling the repo and issuing the 'make' command.  A GUI will appear,
it should be fairly intuitive from there.
